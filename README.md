# Colorado Team Clicky Game

A guessing game using Colorado Sports Team's Logos. Don't click the same image twice, or your score drops to 0. After each attempt, the user score will track their best score.

Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page will shuffle themselves in a random order.

Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game will restart.

*Future Development:*
- Clean up images
- Update READme
